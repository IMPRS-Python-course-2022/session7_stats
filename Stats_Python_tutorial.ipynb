    "Good afternoon! Today we will be working through this tutorial to get familiar with doing statistics in Python. Important note: I am by no means a statistical advisor. I will just show you today how to use a couple of packages to do some statistical tests. Basically, I provide some pointers. When doing analyses on your own data, make your own decisions on which tests to use.\n",
    "The reference guides for the packages we used in this session are here:\n",

    "- [Python's statsistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) \n",
    "Python’s statistics is a built-in Python library for descriptive statistics. It is not intended to be a competitor to libraries such as NumPy or SciPy or full-featured statistics packages aimed at professional statistics. It is aimed at the level of graphing and scientific calculators. \n",
    "- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)\n",
    "NumPy is a library for numerical computing, optimized for working with single- and multi-dimensional arrays. This library contains many routines for statistical analysis.\n",
    "- [SciPy Stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html)\n",
    "SciPy is a library for scientific computing based on NumPy. It offers additional functionality compared to NumPy, including scipy.stats for statistical analysis.\n",
    "- [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) \n",
    "Statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. It supports specifying models using R-style formulas and pandas DataFrames. \n",
    "- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) \n",
    "Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
